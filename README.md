# Attributes Template

Save Time in Data entry of products
Create templates/lists of attributes you use mostly and save them as templates and then just on a single click load it in the attribute tab in the product edit form instead of adding attribute one by one.

You can create separate templates for any category of products
e.g Laptops have ram, hard disk, and CPU attributes in common and you every time add this one by one in each new product you add.

By creating a template for laptops you can just load templates instead of adding attributes one by one.

# Supported Version : All Opencart 3
